DALI 24S API Challenge

I built pic2playlist, a web application that takes random photos from Unsplash using the Unsplash API which is then processed into the Google Cloud Vision API which then feeds into the Spotify Web API to create a playlist based on the object localizer from the Unsplash photo.

APIs Used:
- Unsplash API
- Google Cloud Vision API
- Spotify Web API
